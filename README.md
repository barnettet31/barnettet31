## About Me

<br>
Hi Everyone! My name is Travis Barnette! I've been developing in Javascript for about 2 years now! I first developed a passion for tech at my current job at AutoCorner LLC! I tried out a couple of coding projects starting with [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.org) and then moving on to the challenges on [FrontEndMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)! 

I plan to complete a bootcamp curriculum with [Promineo Tech](https://www.linkedin.com/school/promineo-tech/) starting 9/29/22 so I'm really excited to get started and make some really valuable connections! 

## Ask Me About
You can feel free to ask me about anything software development concerned! I am mostly experienced with Javascript and assorted front end technologies for example: AlpineJS (I work with this tech at work and a couple of projects we use it for), React (I use this library for a lot of the frontendmentor.io projects so I'm fairly familiar), React Native (my company's mobile app is written in ReactNative so I'm familiar with it), and obviously vanilla is in my wheel house. 

Other than that I regularly use Perl, Python, and assorted AWS technologies while at work so I can give some pretty decent input on those technologies! 

I love to learn though so even if I don't know anything I'm ready to search for a solution ðŸ˜ƒ

### Favorite Books

- [Oathbringer, Brandon Sanderson](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/the-stormlight-archive-series/#OATHBRINGER) - Loved this book for leisure reading! I actually have a tattoo that's inspired by a quote from this! 
- [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) - This was easily one of the best books I ever read for Javascript! If you haven't read it yet, then you really should. I practically sleep with it ðŸ¤£
